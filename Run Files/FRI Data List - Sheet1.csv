Kane Brown - What Ifs (Official American Sign Language Video) ft. Lauren Alaina,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rlxgJRsUIM&ab_channel=KaneBrownVEVO,0:07,"You say what if I hurt you
You say what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else 
And I don't need you

What if this goes south
What if I mess you up
What if I break your heart in two then what
Well I hear you girl I feel you girl
But not so fast before you make your mind up
I gotta ask

What if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it what if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them fools 
Just playin' some game

What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby 
I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

What if the sky falls
What if the sun stops burnin' 
We would worry about them what ifs
Til' the world stops turnin' 

Or I could kiss you what if you liked it
Well we ain't never gonna know
Unless we try it 

What if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it what if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them fools 
Just playin' some game

What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby 
I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these what ifs away

You say what if I hurt you
What if I leave you
What if I find somebody else 
And I don't need you 

What if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it what if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them fools

Away

Skinny margarita with a broken heart
So I slid over like a steel guitar
We started talking till I
Saw your boots bounce to the beat
You said, ""Do you dance? Wanna dance with me?""
Next thing I know, I started to think
That we might be on to something

You're putting on a show
No need to take it slow
There's something here, I know

I can feel it in the air, feel it in the whiskey in my hand
In your hips, your body tells me when you start to dance
Maybe this is turning to a ""We should probably get up out of here""
Oh, baby, I swear, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it, mm

You got everybody looking
Looking at you, looking at me
Them words you're whispering in my ear
Girl, they're as smooth as Tennessee

We got all night to go
This flame ain't burning low
There's something here I know

'Cause I can feel it in the air, feel it in the whiskey in my hand
In your hips, your body tells me when you start to dance
Maybe this is turning to a ""We should probably get up out of here""
Oh, baby, I swear, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it
I can feel it in the air

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh, Lord

'Cause I can feel it in the air, feel it in the whiskey in my hand
In your hips, your body tells me when you start to dance
Maybe this is turning to a ""We should probably get up out of here""
Oh, baby, I swear, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it
I can feel it
See, I can feel it in the air
I can feel it
I can feel it"

Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find

I have sailed across the sea
I have wrestled with my demons
And woke up with only me
I have been around the block
Three times maybe four
And I think I deserve just a little more
In front of total strangers won't you kiss me
Flowers for no reason but you miss me
Oh I want to be in love
You're standing on the doorstep in the rain
Cause you couldn't wait to see me once again
Oh I want to be in love
I have made some big mistakes
And I've paid a heavy price
I found a little peace between will and sacrifice
I have watched as all my dreams
Went walking out the door
And I think I deserve just a little more
I'm looking for a heart of gold
I'm looking for a hand to hold
A happy end
Strong and kind
Somewhere to rest my troubled mind
In front of total strangers won't you kiss me
Flowers for no reason but you miss me
Oh I want to be in love
On Tuesday light the candles bring me wine
Wednesday morning I won't get to work on time
Oh I want to be in love
Surprise me as I'm stepping off the plane
Take my hand as they play our song again

1985 JCole in ASL,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPKvGayqhTs&ab_channel=AmberGProductions,,"1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Jokes on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of em' diss me, I'm suprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya'
See if I can paint for you the larger picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, nigga"

And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are

She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say

There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Ah

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man
Well, it surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more no!

Carry on
You will always remember
Carry on
Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry
Don't you cry no more

No more!"

By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
I used to love 'em and leave 'em
Oh, I'd brag about my freedom
How no one could tie me down
Then I met you
Now my heart beats true
Baby, you and me together
Feels more like forever
Than anything I've ever known
We're right on track
I ain't lookin' back
Yeah, I saw the light, I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
Oh, I saw the light, I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
Yeah, I saw the light, I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
Yeah, I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man"
I want to come over Melissa Etheridge ASL cover,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO75T5fLQBc&ab_channel=AmberGProductions,,"I know you're home
You left your light on
You know I'm here
The night is thin
I know you're alone
I watched the car leave
Your lover is gone
Let me in
Open your back door
I just need to touch you once more
I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe
I want to come over
It's a need I can't explain
To see you again
I want to come over
I know your friend
You told her about me
She filled you with fear
Some kind of sin
How can you turn
Denying the fire
Lover I burn
Let me in
Open your back door
I just need to touch you once more
Oh, oh
I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe
I want to come over
It's a need I can't explain
To see you again
I want to come over
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I know you're confused
I know that you're shaken
You think we'll be lost
Once we begin
I know you're weak
I know that you want me
Lover don't speak
Let me in
I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe
I want to come over
It's a need I can't explain
I want to come over
To see you
To see you again"
"An ASL interpretation of Uprising Muse
",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd8jlVltIto&ab_channel=AmberGProductions,,"Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)
Another promise, another scene
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)
Interchanging mind control
Come, let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)"
"ASL Interpretation Wind beneath my wings
",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kq32hCmSDE&ab_channel=AmberGProductions,,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind
So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain
Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings"
